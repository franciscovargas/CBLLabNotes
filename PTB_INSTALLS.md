# Install runtimes/drivers/deps for PTB

Missing any of these packages when installing PTB can result in matlab crashing without explanation other than random dynamic links missing.

## ASIO4ALL (PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL, unless you have ASIO software drivers provided by your graphics card distribution)

* Download latest version at http://www.asio4all.de/ (i.e. tippach.business.t-online.de/asio4all/downloads_11/ASIO4ALL_2_14_English.exe)
* Execute the installer (i.e. ASIO4ALL_2_14_English.exe) 
* When choosing components in the installer setup make sure to tick the Off-Line Settings box

## GSTreamer 

* Dowload the .msi for the latest windows version of GStreamer (https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/windows) 
* Excecute the msi file (i.e. gstreamer-1.0-x86_64-1.12.2.msi)
* Select typical installation (I always do complete just to be safe)

## SVN

* Download latest subversion client from https://sliksvn.com/download/
